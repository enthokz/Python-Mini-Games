IntroduceÂ¶
Welcome, this is the work from novice . Today i want to share about my project which made mini-simply games with python that inspired by video on youtube. 
Here's the link : https://youtu.be/n0tURC_xeyI?si=4bcR6Dq47R_kvXQB . Feel free to analyze and comment it if there any incorrect code. Thank you.

This project, who i called 'mini-simply' games it's about catch a stuff we called 'Bahlil' who hidding in the cave.
The game is easy, guess which cave where bahlil hiding for. If your guess is correct, you win the game. However, if your guess is wrong you have still option to try it again until you guess the correct one.
